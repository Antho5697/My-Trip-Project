# My-Trip-Project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project is a proposal for the development of a tourism mobile application. The application aims to provide tourists with relevant and up-to-date information about tourist places, activities, accommodation, gastronomy and cultural events in the city.

## Background
Storytelling:
Victoria, a young 27-year-old blogger and businesswoman, arrived excitedly in Guayaquil, but when planning her tourist tour she encountered several problems. Victoria wanted to make the most of her time in the city, but she didn't know the most interesting places, the schedules of the tourist places, much less the history behind them.
Frustrated, she started searching the Internet, but found several apps that only gave her general information, without adequate customization for her needs. Victoria was willing to pay for a service that truly provided her with a unique tourist experience.
It is at that moment that Victoria finds our tourist application, which offers her a personalized guide with detailed information on the most interesting tourist places, adapted to her personal preferences, schedules and location. In addition, our application offers you the possibility of learning about the history and curiosities of each place, which makes your experience more enriching.
Thanks to our application, Victoria was able to enjoy her trip in a unique and enriching way, leaving frustrations behind and fully enjoying the city of Guayaquil-Ecuador.

The development of this app solves the problem of the lack of a personalized technological tool for tourism in cities that allows visitors to obtain updated and detailed information about tourist places. As well as providing an interactive and gamified experience for users, which can increase their interest and commitment to the city and its tourist attractions, for example:

-Poor tourist information on existing platforms
-Accessibility issues
-Customization 0
-Communication/feedback

Additionally, the app can also help encourage local tourism and increase the city's visibility as a tourist destination, which could have a positive impact on the local economy.

## How is it used?
The application is accessible from mobile devices, provides tourist information, event details, reservations and maps, improving the user experience while exploring the city, the tourism application offers trip planning, city exploration, personalized recommendations and direct bookings by entering your travel budget.

What is the target audience?

-International Tourists
-National Tourists
-Local explorers
-Business travelers
-Specific groups (Families)
-Cultural/artistic adventurers

## Data sources and AI methods

For the development of the app, a methodology will uses for involved research into tourist and cultural preferences, competitor analysis, market studies, user interface design and usability testing. The application will developing for iOS and Android operating systems, and augmented reality technology was used to improve the user experience. Supported by emerging technologies such as blockchain and the protection of personal data, to guarantee the security and privacy of users. In addition, it complies with municipal, national and international regulations and standards, and is marked by Ecuadorian tourism and intellectual property legislation.

In conclusion, the development of this tourism mobile application is a valuable tool to promote tourism in every city of the world and provide a more complete and satisfactory experience for visitors. Recommendations for future developments include the integration of new functionalities and collaboration with local tourism companies to further improve the cities tourism offering.

## Challenges
If tourism in the city is temporarily stopped due to circumstances such as political movements, natural disasters or pandemics, the app could also be affected in terms of usage and downloads. However, during these periods, the company behind the app could focus on creating content about the current situation in the city and offer updated and useful information for tourists who are in the city or planning a trip in the future. . Additionally, they could also explore opportunities to diversify the app's content and offer options for tourists to explore the city's surroundings instead of being limited to traditional tourist spots.

## What next?

This project lacks several key components to become a reality:

Technical Development: The project is currently just an idea, lacking the actual development of the mobile application. Without programming expertise and technical development, it cannot be brought to life.

Expertise: The project requires individuals with expertise in programming, user interface design, usability testing, and possibly augmented reality technology. 

Resources: Developing a mobile application requires resources such as time, funding, and access to technology. 

Partnerships: Collaboration with local tourism companies and stakeholders could enhance the project's success by providing access to valuable resources, expertise, and support.

Legal Compliance: While the project mentions compliance with regulations and standards, ensuring full compliance with municipal, national, and international laws is essential for the success and legality of the application.

In summary, to turn this project into a reality, it needs technical development, expertise, resources, partnerships, and legal compliance. Without these components, the project will remain an idea.
